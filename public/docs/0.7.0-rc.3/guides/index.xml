Backup This tutorial will show you how to use Stash to backup a Kubernetes deployment. At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube. Now, install Stash in your cluster following the steps here.</description></item><item><title>Minio | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/minio_server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/minio_server/</guid><description>New to Stash?

Using Stash with TLS secured Minio Server Minio is an open source object storage server compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service. You can deploy Minio server in docker container locally, in a kubernetes cluster, Microsoft Azure, GCP etc. You can find a guide for Minio server here. This tutorial will show you how to use Stash to backup a Kubernetes Deployment in a TLS secure Minio Server.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/monitoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/monitoring/</guid><description>New to Stash?

Monitoring Stash Stash has native support for monitoring via Prometheus.
Monitoring Stash Operator Stash operator exposes Prometheus native monitoring data via /metrics endpoint on :56790 port. You can setup a CoreOS Prometheus ServiceMonitor using stash-operator service.
Monitoring Backup Operation Since backup operations are run as cron jobs, Stash can use Prometheus Pushgateway cache metrics for backup operation. The installation scripts for Stash operator deploys a Prometheus Pushgateway as a sidecar container.</description></item><item><title>Offline Backup | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/offline_backup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/offline_backup/</guid><description>New to Stash? Please start here.
Offline Backup This tutorial will show you how to backup a Kubernetes deployment using Stash in offline mode. By default, stash takes backup in online mode where sidecar container is added to take periodic backups and check backups. But sometimes you need to ensure that source data is not being modified while taking backup, that means running backup while keeping workload pod stopped.</description></item><item><title>RBAC | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/rbac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/rbac/</guid><description>New to Stash? Please start here.
Configuring RBAC To use Stash in a RBAC enabled cluster, install Stash with RBAC options. This creates a ClusterRole named stash-sidecar.
Sidecar container added to workloads makes various calls to Kubernetes api. ServiceAccounts used with Deployment, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet and ReplicationController workloads are automatically bound to stash-sidecar ClusterRole by Stash operator. Users should manually add the following RoleBinding to service accounts used with StatefulSet workloads to authorize these api calls.</description></item><item><title>Restore Volumes | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/restore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/restore/</guid><description>New to Stash?

Restore Backup This tutorial will show you how to restore a Stash backup. At first, backup a kubernetes workload volume by following the steps here.
To restore a backup, you need to create a Recovery CRD by specifying Restic, target workload and volume where backup will be restored.
$ kubectl apply -f ./docs/examples/tutorial/recovery.yaml recovery &amp;quot;stash-demo&amp;quot; created apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1 kind: Recovery metadata: name: stash-demo namespace: default spec: workload: kind: Deployment name: stash-demo backend: local: mountPath: /safe/data hostPath: path: /data/stash-test/restic-repo storageSecretName: stash-demo paths: - /source/data recoveredVolumes: - mountPath: /source/data hostPath: path: /data/stash-test/restic-restored Here,</description></item><item><title>Supported Backends | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/backends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/backends/</guid><description>New to Stash?

Stash Backends Backend is where restic stores snapshots. For any backend, a Kubernetes Secret in the same namespace is needed to provide restic repository credentials. This Secret can be configured by setting spec.backend.storageSecretName field. This document lists the various supported backends for Stash and how to configure those.
Local Local backend refers to a local path inside stash sidecar container. Any Kubernetes supported persistent volume can be used here.</description></item><item><title>Table of Contents | Guides</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.3/guides/</guid><description>Guides Guides show you how to perform tasks with Stash.

Supported Workloads Stash supports the following types of Kubernetes workloads.
Deployments To backup a Deployment, create a Restic with matching selectors. You can find a full working demo in examples folder.
ReplicaSets To backup a ReplicaSet, create a Restic with matching selectors. You can find a full working demo in examples folder.
ReplicationControllers To backup a ReplicationController, create a Restic with matching selectors.</description></item></channel></rss>
