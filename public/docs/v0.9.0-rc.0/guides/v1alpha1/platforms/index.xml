Using Stash with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) This tutorial will show you how to use Stash to backup and restore a volume in Azure Kubernetes Service. Here, we are going to backup the /source/data folder of a busybox pod into Azure Blob Storage. Then, we are going to show how to recover this data into a PersistentVolumeClaim(PVC). We are going to also re-deploy deployment using this recovered volume.</description></item><item><title>EKS | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.0/guides/v1alpha1/platforms/eks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.0/guides/v1alpha1/platforms/eks/</guid><description>New to Stash?
