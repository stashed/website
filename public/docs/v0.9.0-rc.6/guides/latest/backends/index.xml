Please start here.
Stash Backends Stash supports various backends for storing data snapshots. It can be a cloud storage like GCS bucket, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage etc. or a Kubernetes persistent volume like HostPath, PersistentVolumeClaim, NFS etc.
The following diagram shows how Stash sidecar container accesses and backs up data into a backend.
Fig: Stash Backend Overview You have to create a Repository object which contains backend information and a Secret which contains necessary credentials to access the backend.</description></item><item><title>GCS Backend | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.6/guides/latest/backends/gcs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.6/guides/latest/backends/gcs/</guid><description>Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Stash supports Google Cloud Storage(GCS) as a backend.
