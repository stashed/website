Recoveries What is Recovery A Recovery is a Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD). It provides configuration for restoring a backup taken using Stash. You only need to specify the Repository, Snapshot and path you want to recover and volume where the backup will be restored.
Recovery Spec As with all other Kubernetes objects, a Recovery needs apiVersion, kind, and metadata fields. It also needs a .</description></item><item><title>Repository Overview</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.8.2/concepts/crds/repository/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.8.2/concepts/crds/repository/</guid><description>New to Stash?

Repository What is Repository A Repository is a Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD). It provides information of a restic repository in Kubernetes native way. When stash sidecar creates a restic repository for backup in the desired backend, it also creates a Repository CRD object with relevant information of the repository. This enables a user to view backup status of the workloads very easily.
Repository CRD structure A sample Repository CRD object for backup a Deployment in local backend is shown below,</description></item><item><title>Restic Overview</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.8.2/concepts/crds/restic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.8.2/concepts/crds/restic/</guid><description>New to Stash?

Restics What is Restic A Restic is a Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD). It provides declarative configuration for restic in a Kubernetes native way. You only need to describe the desired backup operations in a Restic object, and the Stash operator will reconfigure the matching workloads to the desired state for you.
Restic Spec As with all other Kubernetes objects, a Restic needs apiVersion, kind, and metadata fields.</description></item><item><title>Snapshot Overview</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.8.2/concepts/crds/snapshot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.8.2/concepts/crds/snapshot/</guid><description>New to Stash?

Snapshot What is Snapshot A Snapshot is a representation of restic backup snapshot in a Kubernetes native way. With the help of Aggregated API Servers, Stash provides the users a way to view,list and delete snapshots from restic repositories. Now, a user can view some crucial information of snapshots like creationTimestamp, snapshot id, backed up path etc. In future, this will enable the users to recover a particular snapshot using stash.</description></item></channel></rss>
