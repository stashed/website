Snapshot What is Snapshot A Snapshot is a representation of restic backup snapshot in a Kubernetes native way. With the help of Aggregated API Servers, Stash provides the users a way to view,list and delete snapshots from restic repositories. Now, a user can view some crucial information of snapshots like creationTimestamp, snapshot id, backed up path etc. In future, this will enable the users to recover a particular snapshot using stash.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.4/guides/gke/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/0.7.0-rc.4/guides/gke/</guid><description>Using Stash with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) This tutorial will show you how to use Stash to backup and restore a Kubernetes deployment in Google Kubernetes Engine.

This guide will give you an overview of what is an addon, how addons work and a list of Stash addons.
What is an Addon Stash 0.9.0+ uses two different models for backup/restore based on target types. One of them is sidecar model where Stash injects a sidecar/init-container into the targeted workload for backup/restore. Another is job model where backup or restore is done via an external job.</description></item><item><title>Addons | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.2/guides/latest/addons/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.2/guides/latest/addons/overview/</guid><description>Stash Addons Stash 0.9.0+ supports extending its functionality through addons.

BackupBlueprint What is BackupBlueprint Stash uses 1-1 mapping among Repository, BackupConfiguration and the target. So, whenever you want to backup a target(workload/PV/PVC/database), you have to create a Repository and BackupConfiguration object. This could become tiresome when you are trying to backup similar types of target and the Repository and BackupConfiguration has only slight difference. To mitigate this problem, Stash provides a way to specify a blueprint for these two objects via BackupBlueprint crd.</description></item><item><title>BackupBlueprint Overview</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.1/concepts/crds/backupblueprint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.1/concepts/crds/backupblueprint/</guid><description>New to Stash?

BackupSession What is BackupSession A BackupSession is a Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition(CRD) which represents a backup run of the respective target(s) referenced by a BackupConfiguration/BackupBatch in a Kubernetes native way.
Stash operator creates a Kubernetes CronJob according to the schedule defined in a BackupConfiguration/BackupBatch. On each backup schedule, this CronJob creates a BackupSession object. It points to the respective BackupConfiguration/BackupBatch.

We are very excited to announce Stash v0.9.0-rc.0. This release introduces v1beta1 API and a design overhaul. The new API and design enable Stash to support the use cases that were not possible before. This makes Stash more powerful, transparent, extensible and customizable. We are expecting that this new API will graduate to GA after some maturity. Check out the new architecture from here.
What&amp;rsquo;s New This release introduces lots of new features and changes.</description></item><item><title>Changelog | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.0/welcome/changelog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.0/welcome/changelog/</guid><description>Current Release CHANGELOG-0.9.md Older Releases CHANGELOG-0.8.md CHANGELOG-0.7.md CHANGELOG-0.6.md CHANGELOG-0.5.md CHANGELOG-0.4.md CHANGELOG-0.3.md CHANGELOG-0.2.md CHANGELOG-0.1.md</description></item><item><title>Changelog | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.1/welcome/changelog-0.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.1/welcome/changelog-0.1/</guid><description>Change Log 0.1.0 (2017-06-27) Implemented enhancements:

Using Stash with Amazon EKS This tutorial will show you how to use Stash to backup and restore a volume in Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS). Here, we are going to backup the /source/data folder of a busybox pod into AWS S3 bucket. Then, we are going to show how to recover this data into a PersistentVolumeClaim(PVC).
