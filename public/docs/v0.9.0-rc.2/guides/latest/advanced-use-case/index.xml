You can provide a template for PVC in RestoreSession. Stash will create PVCs according to the template, then it will restore data in that PVC. Then you can use the cloned PVCs to deploy your desired workload. This guide will show you how to clone backed up data into new PVCs using Stash.</description></item><item><title>File Ownership | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.2/guides/latest/advanced-use-case/ownership/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.2/guides/latest/advanced-use-case/ownership/</guid><description>Handling Restored File Ownership in Stash Stash preserves permission bits of the restored files. However, it may change ownership (owner uid and gid) of the restored files in some cases. This tutorial will explain when and how ownership of the restored files can be changed. Then, we are going to explain how we can avoid or resolve this problem.
