Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using kind.
To keep Prometheus resources isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace to deploy Prometheus server.</description></item><item><title>CoreOS Prometheus Operator | Stash</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/monitoring/coreos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/monitoring/coreos/</guid><description>Monitoring Using CoreOS Prometheus Operator CoreOS prometheus-operator provides simple and Kubernetes native way to deploy and configure Prometheus server.

Please start here.
Monitoring Stash Stash has native support for monitoring via Prometheus. You can use builtin Prometheus scraper or CoreOS Prometheus Operator to monitor Stash. This tutorial will show you how this monitoring works with Stash and how to enable them.
Overview Stash uses Prometheus PushGateway to export the metrics for backup &amp;amp; restore operations. Following diagram shows the logical structure of Stash monitoring flow.</description></item></channel></rss>
