# Backup

This tutorial will show you how to use Stash to backup a Kubernetes deployment. At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster,
and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster,
you can create one by using [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). Now, install Stash in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/0.6.2/setup/install).

In this tutorial, we are going to backup the `/source/data` folder of a `busybox` pod into a local backend. First deploy the following `busybox` Deployment in your cluster. Here we are using a git repository as source volume for demonstration purpose.

```console
$  kubectl apply -f ./docs/examples/tutorial/busybox.yaml
deployment "stash-demo" created
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: stash-demo
  name: stash-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: stash-demo
      name: busybox
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - sleep
        - "3600"
        image: busybox
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: busybox
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /source/data
          name: source-data
      restartPolicy: Always
      volumes:
      - gitRepo:
          repository: https://github.com/appscode/stash-data.git
        name: source-data
```

Run the following command to confirm that `busybox` pods are running.

```console
$ kubectl get pods -l app=stash-demo
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
stash-demo-788ffcf9c6-6t6lj   1/1       Running   0          12s
```

Now, create a `Secret` that contains the key `RESTIC_PASSWORD`. This will be used as the password for your restic repository.

```console
$ kubectl create secret generic stash-demo --from-literal=RESTIC_PASSWORD=changeit
secret "stash-demo" created
```

You can check that the secret was created like this:

```yaml
$ kubectl get secret stash-demo -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
  RESTIC_PASSWORD: Y2hhbmdlaXQ=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2017-12-04T05:24:22Z
  name: stash-demo
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "22328"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/secrets/stash-demo
  uid: 62aa8ef8-d8b3-11e7-be92-0800277f19c0
type: Opaque
```

Now, create a `Restic` CRD with selectors matching the labels of the `busybox` Deployment.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f ./docs/examples/tutorial/restic.yaml
restic "stash-demo" created
```

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restic
metadata:
  name: stash-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: stash-demo
  fileGroups:
  - path: /source/data
    retentionPolicyName: 'keep-last-5'
  backend:
    local:
      mountPath: /safe/data
      hostPath:
        path: /data/stash-test/restic-repo
    storageSecretName: stash-demo
  schedule: '@every 1m'
  volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /source/data
    name: source-data
  retentionPolicies:
  - name: 'keep-last-5'
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

Here,

 - `spec.selector` is used to select workloads upon which this `Restic` configuration will be applied. `Restic` always selects workloads in the same Kubernetes namespace. In this tutorial, labels of `busybox` Deployment match this `Restic`'s selectors. If multiple `Restic` objects are matched to a given workload, Stash operator will error out and avoid adding sidecar container.
 - `spec.retentionPolicies` defines an array of retention policies, which can be used in `fileGroups` using `retentionPolicyName`.
 - `spec.fileGroups` indicates an array of local paths that will be backed up using restic. For each path, users can also specify the retention policy for old snapshots using `retentionPolicyName`, which must be defined in `spec.retentionPolicies`. Here, we are backing up the `/source/data` folder and only keeping the last 5 snapshots.
 - `spec.backend.local` indicates that restic will store the snapshots in a local path `/safe/data`. For the purpose of this tutorial, we are using an `hostPath` to store the snapshots. But any Kubernetes volume that can be mounted locally can be used as a backend (example, NFS, Ceph, etc). Stash can also store snapshots in cloud storage solutions like S3, GCS, Azure, etc. To use a remote backend, you need to configure the storage secret to include your cloud provider credentials and set one of `spec.backend.(s3|gcs|azure|swift|b2)`. Please visit [here](/docs/0.6.2/guides/backends) for more detailed examples.

  - `spec.backend.storageSecretName` points to the Kubernetes secret created earlier in this tutorial. `Restic` always points to secrets in its own namespace. This secret is used to pass restic repository password and other cloud provider secrets to `restic` binary.
  - `spec.schedule` is a [cron expression](https://github.com/robfig/cron/blob/v2/doc.go#L26) that indicates that file groups will be backed up every 1 minute.
  - `spec.volumeMounts` refers to volumes to be mounted in `stash` sidecar to get access to fileGroup path `/source/data`.

Stash operator watches for `Restic` objects using Kubernetes api. Stash operator will notice that the `busybox` Deployment matches the selector for `stash-demo` Restic object. So, it will add a sidecar container named `stash` to `busybox` Deployment and restart the running `busybox` pods. Since a local backend is used in `stash-demo` Restic, sidecar container will mount the corresponding persistent volume.

```console
$ kubectl get pods -l app=stash-demo
NAME                          READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
stash-demo-788ffcf9c6-6t6lj   0/1       Terminating   0          3m
stash-demo-79554ff97b-wsdx2   2/2       Running       0          49s
```

```yaml
$ kubectl get deployment stash-demo -o yaml

```

Now, wait a few minutes so that restic can take a backup of the `/source/data` folder. To confirm, check the `status.backupCount` of `stash-demo` Restic CRD.

```yaml
$ kubectl get restic stash-demo -o yaml

apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restic
metadata:
  clusterName: ""
  creationTimestamp: 2017-12-04T06:10:37Z

  generation: 0
  initializers: null

        path: /data/stash-test/restic-repo
    storageSecretName: stash-demo
  fileGroups:
  - path: /source/data
    retentionPolicyName: keep-last-5
  retentionPolicies:
  - keepLast: 5
    name: keep-last-5
    prune: true
  schedule: '@every 1m'
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: stash-demo
  volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /source/data
    name: source-data
status:
  backupCount: 1

  lastBackupDuration: 1.45596698s
  lastBackupTime: 2017-12-04T06:11:41Z
```

You can also exec into the `busybox` Deployment to check list of snapshots.

```console
$ kubectl get pods -l app=stash-demo
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
stash-demo-79554ff97b-wsdx2   2/2       Running   0          3m

$ kubectl exec -it stash-demo-79554ff97b-wsdx2 -c stash sh
/ # export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=/safe/data/Deployment/stash-demo
/ # export RESTIC_PASSWORD=changeit
/ # restic snapshots
password is correct
ID        Date                 Host        Tags        Directory
----------------------------------------------------------------------
139fa21e  2017-12-04 06:14:42  stash-demo              /source/data
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Disable Backup
To stop taking backup of `/source/data` folder, delete the `stash-demo` Restic CRD. As a result, Stash operator will remove the sidecar container from `busybox` Deployment.
```console
$ kubectl delete restic stash-demo
restic "stash-demo" deleted

$ kubectl get pods -l app=stash-demo
NAME                          READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
stash-demo-79554ff97b-wsdx2   2/2       Terminating   0          3m
stash-demo-788ffcf9c6-p47p7   1/1       Running       0          5s
```

## Cleaning up

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:
```console
$ kubectl delete deployment stash-demo
$ kubectl delete secret stash-demo
$ kubectl delete restic stash-demo
```

If you would like to uninstall Stash operator, please follow the steps [here](/docs/0.6.2/setup/uninstall).
