At the heart of Stash, it is a Kubernetes controller. It uses Custom Resource Definition(CRD) to specify targets and behaviors of backup and restore process in a Kubernetes native way. A simplified architecture of Stash is shown below:
Fig: Stash Architecture Components Stash consists of various components that implement backup and restore logic. This section will give you a brief overview of such components.</description></item><item><title>Stash Overview</title><link>https://stash.run/docs/v2020.07.08-beta.0/concepts/what-is-stash/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stash.run/docs/v2020.07.08-beta.0/concepts/what-is-stash/overview/</guid><description>Stash Stash by AppsCode is a cloud native data backup and recovery solution for Kubernetes workloads. If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you might want to take backup of your disks, databases etc. Traditional tools are too complex to setup and maintain in a dynamic compute environment like Kubernetes. Stash is a Kubernetes operator that uses restic or Kubernetes CSI Driver VolumeSnapshotter functionality to address these issues. Using Stash, you can backup Kubernetes volumes mounted in workloads, stand-alone volumes and databases.</description></item></channel></rss>
